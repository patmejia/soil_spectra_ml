# soil spectra ml
### predictive clay mineral in soil spectroscopy
---

soilspectraml is an open-source initiative aimed at developing machine learning models for predictive soil spectroscopy, with a focus on accurate clay content prediction from mid-infrared (mir) soil spectra.

## features

- **clay content prediction**: utilizes mir soil spectroscopy for precise clay content estimation.
- **interoperable models**: ensures model consistency and accuracy across diverse mir instruments.
- **open soil spectral library (ossl) utilization**: leverages the ossl for robust model training and evaluation.
- **machine learning framework**: incorporates a modular ml framework allowing easy model iteration and evaluation.

## getting started

1. **prerequisites**:
    - python 3.7+
    - relevant libraries and dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    
2. **installation**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **dataset**:
    - place your dataset in the `data/raw` directory following the cookiecutter data science directory structure.

4. **training models**:
    ```bash
    python src/models/train_model.py
    ```

5. **model evaluation**:
    - evaluation metrics and model performance can be viewed in the generated reports in the `reports` directory.
