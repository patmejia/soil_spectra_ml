# soil spectra ml
###  *predictive clay mineral in soil spectroscopy*
soilspectraml is an open-source initiative aimed at developing machine learning models for predictive soil spectroscopy, with a focus on accurate clay content prediction from mid-infrared (mir) soil spectra.

## overview
find a quick overview of soil spectroscopy and the ss4gg hackathon [here](https://github.com/patmejia/soil_data_research#soil-research).

*this image illustrates the size-based classification of soil minerals, highlighting the distinctive attributes of clay in terms of texture, water retention, and nutrient interaction.*


## objective
> develop a machine learning model to accurately predict soil clay content across diverse mir instruments, using root mean squared error (rmse) as the performance metric.
## download Data
a. **authenticate with kaggle api**: 
   - see this [article](https://patimejia.medium.com/downloading-datasets-from-kaggle-ecdc4d0bf4e7) for instructions on how to authenticate with the kaggle api: 


c. **download dataset**: 
   - run the following command to download the dataset:
     ```bash
     cd data/raw
     kaggle competitions download -c ss4gg-hackathon-mir-soil-spectroscopy
     ```
   - this command downloads the dataset for the ss4gg-hackathon-mir-soil-spectroscopy competition to the current directory (i.e., `data/raw/`).
## features
- **clay content prediction**: utilizes mir soil spectroscopy for precise clay content estimation.
- **interoperable models**: ensures model consistency and accuracy across diverse mir instruments.
- **open soil spectral library [ossl](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ss4gg-hackathon-mir-soil-spectroscopy/data) utilization**: leverages the ossl for robust model training and evaluation.
- **machine learning framework**: incorporates a modular ml framework allowing easy model iteration and evaluation.
