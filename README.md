# SoilSpectraML: Predictive Soil Spectroscopy Models

SoilSpectraML is an open-source initiative aimed at developing machine learning models for predictive soil spectroscopy, with a focus on accurate clay content prediction from Mid-Infrared (MIR) soil spectra.

## Features

- **Clay Content Prediction**: Utilizes MIR soil spectroscopy for precise clay content estimation.
- **Interoperable Models**: Ensures model consistency and accuracy across diverse MIR instruments.
- **Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL) Utilization**: Leverages the OSSL for robust model training and evaluation.
- **Machine Learning Framework**: Incorporates a modular ML framework allowing easy model iteration and evaluation.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - Python 3.7+
    - Relevant libraries and dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    
2. **Installation**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Dataset**:
    - Place your dataset in the `data/raw` directory following the Cookiecutter Data Science directory structure.

4. **Training Models**:
    ```bash
    python src/models/train_model.py
    ```

5. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluation metrics and model performance can be viewed in the generated reports in the `reports` directory.
